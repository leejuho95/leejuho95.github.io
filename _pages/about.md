I am a Ph.D student in the Physics department at POSTECH. I am a member of the P4 Lab at POSTECH, under the supervision of Prof. Gunsu Yun. Previously, I completed B.S. in Physics at POSTECH.

My research interests focus on exploring high-energy density plasma systems using various optical diagnoses.
